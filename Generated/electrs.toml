# If you're setting password manually instead of cookie files, 
# configuration file is the only way to set it due to security reasons.

# See configuration file example at:
# https://github.com/romanz/electrs/blob/master/doc/config_example.toml

# Prefer cookie file unless you have btc-rpc-proxy or a good reason to use username:password
# cookie and cookie_file can NOT be specified at the same tie.
